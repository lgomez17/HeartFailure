# HeartFailure

For this project I wanted to focus on heart failure because it is a population that has a high readmission rate. As a medical social worker, I am constantly in meetings about length of hospital stay, hospital readmission rates, and value-based care. A population that often comes up as high utilizers are patients with heart failure. My goal for this project was to predict heart disease.
