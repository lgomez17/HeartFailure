# Heart Disease 

For this project I wanted to focus on heart failure because it is a population that has a high readmission rate. As a medical social worker, I am constantly in meetings about length of hospital stay, hospital readmission initiatives, and value-based care. A population that often comes up as high utilizers are patients with heart failure. My goal for this project was to predict heart disease using ML. My plan was to import the data, clean the data, split the data into training/test sets, create a model (sklearn), train the model, make predictions, evaluate and improve predictions.
